# friend.ai

### Description
This was a project for the Quinnipiac Computing Club hackathon. We made a platform for people to be able to create virtual versions of their friends by using their messages as context for ChatGPT's API to mimic their style of writing and conversation.

### Future Developments
Use deepfake models to build virtual avatars that replicate their faces and voices
